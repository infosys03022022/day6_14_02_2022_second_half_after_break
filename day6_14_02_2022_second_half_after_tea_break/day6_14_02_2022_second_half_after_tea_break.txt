Suppose we have a manager and we have a clerk and for manager we need to store id, name and yearsOfExp.
For Clerk we need to store id, name and typingSpeed.

    public class Clerk {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int typingSpeed;
    }

    public class Manager {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    privae int yearsOfExp }

 Observation: In both the classes id and name are common.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid this we can define a base class and in the base class , we can keep id and name and
in the child/derived classes we keep the attribute which is specific to the Clerk and Manager.
So to access the member of the Parent/Base class we can declare the members of the base clas as protected.So public or protected or default ( for default the derived class and the base class
should be in the same package ) can be accessed or inherited in the sub classes but we 
cannot inherit the private members in the derived/child/sub-classes. 
  public class Employee {
    protected int id;
    protected String name;  
   }

  public class Clerk extends Employee {
   private int typingSpeed;
  }

  public class Manager extends Employee {
   private int yearsOfExp;
 }
